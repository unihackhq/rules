**We believe that every single person has the right to hack in a safe and
welcoming environment.**

This is why we have a code of conduct that applies to participants, sponsors,
judges, mentors, organisers, volunteers, guests, observers and any other person
at a UNIHACK event, or any online interactions in relation to a UNIHACK event
(e.g. Discord, Slack, the UNIHACKers Facebook Group).

**TL;DR.** Be nice. Be supportive. Be friendly. Have fun.

### Making a safe event

**We do not tolerate harassment.**

Harassment includes but is not limited to:

- offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation,
  disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, social class,
  economic status, veteran status, or technology choices;
- use of sexual language or imagery;
- deliberate intimidation, stalking or following;
- harassing photography or recording;
- sustained disruption of talks or other events;
- inappropriate physical contact;
- and, unwelcome sexual attention.

If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as
harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

**If you are asked to stop any harassing behaviour, you must comply immediately.**

As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our
hackathon are equally subject to the Code of Conduct.

We also like to explicitly note that all attendees - including sponsors - should
not create a sexualised environment. This includes a ban on sexualised
clothing/uniforms/costumes for sponsor representatives. All attendees should not
use sexualised images, activities, or other material in their hacks or during
the event.

### Photography

**We encourage photography to be taken at our events, with consent.**

You must give a reasonable chance for participants to opt out from being
photographed. If a person objects to their photo being taken, then you must
comply with that request.

It is inappropriate to take photographs of people where they have a reasonable
expectation of privacy. This includes, but not limited to, in bathrooms or where
participants are sleeping.

### Reporting incidents

If you ever feel uncomfortable, witness someone else being harassed, or think
there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it
immediately.

All reporters have the right to remain anonymous when reporting.

All incidents should be reported using one of the following methods below:

- Directly message the UNIHACK Melbourne social media accounts on
  [Facebook][facebook] or [Twitter][twitter]

- Email to [team@unihack.net][email]

### If you violate the Code of Conduct...

If an organiser has approached you about an incident that has been determined to
be a Code of Conduct violation, you must:

- listen to the complaint with an open mind;
- not be dismissive of the complainant;
- understand any advice given on how to act in future;
- and, comply with the directions of the organisers.

The organisers may take any action it deems appropriate to the situation. This
includes warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility
for a refund of any type. Severe or repeated violations will result in a
lifetime ban and/or reporting the incident to law enforcement.
